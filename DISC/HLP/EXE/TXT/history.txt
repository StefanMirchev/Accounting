  Win32Pad will now automatically use the actual filename instead of the old 8.3 combination. (This is something that notepad does. When you give it a filena~1.txt it will expand it automatically.) 
+ Now when you select a piece of text and then do Find/Replace it will use the selected text as the default Search string. 
+ You can also open files by Dropping them from Windows Explorer.
